# Optic Library: A modern C++ toolkit

## Overview
The Optic Library is a comprehensive collection of modern Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), implemented in C++. Primarily designed for educational use, it explores efficient and robust implementations that go beyond the typical curriculum for Computer Science students. Whenever possible, this project aims to enhance traditional DSA components, focusing on improved performance and usability.

## Project Structure
- **data_structures/**: Contains various custom data structures.
- **algorithms/**: Includes a wide range of algorithms, from basic to advanced.
- **memory/**: Features custom memory management techniques.
- **examples/**: Provides practical examples of how to use the components.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Optic Library, clone this repository and explore the examples provided in the `examples/` directory.
